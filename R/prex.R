#' Render a "prex"
#'
#' @description
#' `prex()` is like [reprex()], but much less reproducible!
#'   * Code is evaluated in the global environment of the current R session.
#'   * Current working directory is used.
#'   * `advertise = FALSE` is the default.
#' This violates many principles of a true reprex, which is why the `prex()`
#' family of functions is unexported. The main motivation is to make
#' `prex_rtf()` available for preparing code snippets that are scattered around
#' a talk and that can't necessarily be self-contained.
#'
#' Specific `reprex()` arguments do not appear as `prex()` arguments or may have
#' different capabilities (i.e., more limited).
#' * `std_out_err`: not offered in `prex()`

#' # compare and contrast to get a feel for reprex() vs prex()
#' reprex(ls())     # character(0)
#' prex(ls())       # whatever is lying around your current workspace
#'
#' reprex(search()) # won't reflect anything you attach in .Rprofile
#' prex(search())   # generally does reflect packages attached in .Rprofile
#'
#' reprex(getwd())  # a reprex directory below session temp directory
#' prex(getwd())    # current working directory
