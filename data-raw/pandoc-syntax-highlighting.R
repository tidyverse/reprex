# How does Pandoc do syntax highlighting?
# https://pandoc.org/chunkedhtml-demo/13-syntax-highlighting.html
# "The Haskell library skylighting is used for highlighting."

# Pandoc/skylighting store themes using the
# Syntax-Highlighting framework from KDE Frameworks

# Learn the meaning of the styles (classes) supported by Pandoc here:
# https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kate/katepart/highlight.html
#   see "Available Default Styles"
# https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kate/katepart/color-themes.html
#   see "Default Text Styles"

# this is me taking the styles Pandoc/skylighting expects,
# noting what they are meant for conceptually,
# and picking the starry-night color alias/variable that seems the best fit
