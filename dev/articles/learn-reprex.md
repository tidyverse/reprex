# How to use reprex

Materials from an [RStudio
webinar](https://resources.rstudio.com/webinars) delivered September
2018:

### Help me help you: Creating reproducible examples with reprex

What is a reprex? It’s a **repr**oducible **ex**ample. Making a great
reprex is both an art and a science and this webinar will cover both
aspects. A reprex makes a conversation about code more efficient and
pleasant for all. This comes up whenever you ask someone for help,
report a bug in software, or propose a new feature. The reprex package
(<https://reprex.tidyverse.org>) makes it especially easy to prepare R
code as a reprex, in order to share on sites such as
<https://community.rstudio.com>, <https://github.com>, or
<https://stackoverflow.com>. The habit of making little, rigorous,
self-contained examples also has the great side effect of making you
think more clearly about your programming problems.
