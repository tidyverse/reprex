While using a built-in dataset for a reprex is ideal, sometimes you need to troubleshoot code with a bit of outside data. Meet [datapasta](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/datapasta), a package by [Miles McBain](https://twitter.com/milesmcbain) for "reducing resistance associated with copying and pasting data to and from R." Like reprex, datapasta has addin functionality, so you can select commands from the RStudio Addins and/or associate keyboard shortcuts with them for easy use.

## Scenario 1: From spreadsheet to reprex with `tribble_paste()`

It's easy to copy and paste nicely formatted data from a spreadsheet with datapasta's `tribble_paste()` functionality. I've found the simplest method to be: 

1. Copy data from a source onto your clipboard.  
2. Click **Paste as tribble** from the datapasta section of the RStudio Addins drop-down.  
3. Be sure to assign your data frame to a name, so you can use it elsewhere in your reprex.

While the output of `tribble_paste()` doesn't have the same level of detail it would with [`dput()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/dput.html), it works well enough for most scenarios, with the added benefit of being easy to read on the screen.

## Scenario 2: From R object to tibble with `dpasta()`

Now let’s say you have a data frame in R that you want to use in a reprex. You can use datapasta's `dpasta()` function to render your object into the same format as the result of `tribble_paste()`, above.

</div>

## Fin

There's more to datapasta than discussed here, so be sure to check out its [documentation](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/datapasta). Don't forget, when it comes to reprex, less is always more, so wield the power of datapasta wisely.
