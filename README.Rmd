### reprex

Prepare reproducible examples for posting to [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r), etc.

  * Given R code on the clipboard, in a file, or as expression,
  * run it via `rmarkdown::render()`,
  * with deliberate choices re: arguments and setup chunk.
  * Get resulting runnable code + output as markdown,
  * formatted for target venue, e.g. `gh` or `so`,
  * on the clipboard and, optionally, in a file.
  * Preview an HTML version in RStudio viewer or default browser.

### Installation

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jennybc/reprex")
```
  
### Quick demo

Let's say you copy this code onto your clipboard:

```{r define-demo-code, include = FALSE}
demo_code <- c(
  "(y <- 1:4)",
  "mean(y)"
)
writeLines(demo_code, "README-tmp.R")
```

```{r reveal-demo-code, asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
cat(paste(demo_code, collapse = "\n"))
```

Then you load the `reprex` package and call the main function `reprex()`, where the default target venue is GitHub:

```{r simulate-load-and-call, eval = FALSE}
library(reprex)
reprex()
```

A nicely rendered HTML preview will display in RStudio's Viewer (if you're in RStudio) or your default browser otherwise.

![html-preview](README-viewer-screenshot.png "HTML preview in RStudio")

The relevant bit of GitHub-flavored Markdown is ready to be pasted from your clipboard:

```{r load-and-call, include = FALSE}
writeLines('reprex::reprex(infile = "README-tmp.R", outfile = "README-tmp_gh")',
           "README-tmp-wrapper.R")
devtools::clean_source("README-tmp-wrapper.R", quiet = TRUE)
md_file <- list.files(pattern = "README-tmp_gh.md")
md_content <- readLines(md_file)
```

```{r reveal-md-content, asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
cat(paste(md_content, collapse = "\n"))
```

Here's what that Markdown would look like rendered in a GitHub issue:

```{r render-md-content, child = md_file}
```

Anyone else can copy, paste, and run this immediately.

But wait, there's more!

  * Set the target venue to Stack Overflow with `reprex(venue = "so")`.
  * By default, figures are uploaded to [imgur.com](http://imgur.com) and resulting URL is dropped into an inline image tag.
  * Alternatives to clipboard input:
    - `reprex(infile = "my_reprex.R")` gets the code from file
    - `reprex({(y <- 1:4); mean(y)})` gets code from expression

```{r clean-up, include = FALSE}
leftovers <- list.files(pattern = "README-tmp", ignore.case = TRUE)
if(length(leftovers)) file.remove(leftovers)
```

### Reproducible examples

What is a `reprex`? It's a {repr}oducible {ex}ample. Coined by Romain Francois [on twitter](https://twitter.com/romain_francois/status/530011023743655936).

Where and why are they used?

-   A Stack Overflow question that includes a proper reprex is [much more likely to get answered](http://stackoverflow.com/help/no-one-answers), by the most knowledgeable (and therefore busy!) people.
-   A [GitHub issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) that includes a proper reprex is more likely to achieve your goal: getting a bug fixed or getting a new feature, in a finite amount of time.

What are the main requirements?

  * Use the smallest, simplest, most [built-in data](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) possible.
    - Think: `iris` or `mtcars`. Bore me.
    - If you must make some objects, minimize their size and complexity.
    - Get just a bit of something with `head()` or by indexing with the result of `sample()`. If anything is random, consider using `set.seed()` to make it repeatable.
    - `dput()` is a good way to get the code to create an object you have lying around. Copy and paste the *result* of this into your reprex. *(We might try to facilitate this in future, see [#7](https://github.com/jennybc/reprex/issues/7).)*
    - Look at official examples and try to write in that style. Consider adapting one.
  * Include commands on a strict "need to run" basis.
    - Ruthlessly strip out anything unrelated to the specific matter at hand.
    - Include every single command that is required, e.g. loading specific packages via `library(foo)`.
  * Consider including info on your OS and your versions of R version and add-on packages, if it's conceivable that it matters. Use `reprex(..., si = TRUE)` for this.
  * Pack it in, pack it out, and don't take liberties with other people's computers.
    - If you change options, store original values at the start, do your thing, then restore them: `opar <- par(pch = 19) <blah blah blah> par(opar)`.
    - If you create files, delete them when you're done: `write(x, "foo.txt") <blah blah blah> file.remove("foo.txt")`.
    - Don't delete files or objects that you didn't create in the first place.
    - Don't mask built-in functions, i.e. don't define a new function named `c`.
    - Take advantage of R's built-in ability to create temporary files and directories. Read up on [`tempfile()` and `tempdir()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/tempfile.html).
  * Whitespace rationing is not in effect. Use good [coding style](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).
  
But won't that take time and effort?

  * Yes, yes it will!
  * 80% of the time you will solve your own problem in the course of writing an excellent reprex. YMMV.
  * The remaining 20% of the time, you will create a reprex that is more likely to elicit the desired behavior in others.

### Package philosophy

The reprex code:

  * Must run and, therefore, should be run **by the person posting**. No faking it.
  * Should be easy for others to digest, so **they don't necessarily have to run it**. You are encouraged to include selected bits of output. :scream:
  * Should be easy for others to copy + paste + run, **iff they so choose**. Don't let inclusion of output break executability.

Accomplished like so:

  * use `rmarkdown::render` or, under the hood, `knitr::spin` to run the code and capture output that would display in R console
  * use chunk option `comment = "#>"` to include the output while retaining executability
