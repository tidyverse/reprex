<a href="https://nypdecider.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/help-me-help-you.gif"><img src="man/figures/help-me-help-you.png" align="right" /></a>Prepare reprexes for posting to [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r), or [Slack snippets](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204145658-Create-a-snippet). What is a `reprex`? It's a **repr**oducible **ex**ample, as coined by [Romain Francois](https://twitter.com/romain_francois/status/530011023743655936).

Given R code on the clipboard, selected in RStudio, as an expression (quoted or not), or in a file ...

* run it via `rmarkdown::render()`,
* with deliberate choices re: arguments and setup chunk.

Get resulting runnable code + output as

* Markdown, formatted for target venue, e.g. `gh` or `so`, or as
* R code, augmented with commented output.

Result is returned invisibly, placed on the clipboard, and written to a file.
Preview an HTML version in RStudio viewer or default browser.

## Installation

Install from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("reprex")
```

or get a development version from GitHub:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/reprex")
```
  
## Usage  

```{r include = FALSE}
library(reprex)
```

Let's say you copy this code onto your clipboard:

```{r include = FALSE}
demo_code <- c(
  "(y <- 1:4)",
  "mean(y)"
)
```

```{r asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
cat(demo_code, sep = "\n")
```

Then call `reprex()`, where the default target venue is GitHub:

```{r eval = FALSE}
reprex()
```

A nicely rendered HTML preview will display in RStudio's Viewer (if you're in RStudio) or your default browser otherwise.

The relevant bit of GitHub-flavored Markdown is ready to be pasted from your clipboard:

```{r asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA, message = FALSE}
md_content <-
  reprex(input = demo_code, outfile = "README-tmp_gh", show = FALSE)
cat(md_content, sep = "\n")
```

Here's what that Markdown would look like rendered in a GitHub issue:

```{r child = "README-tmp_gh_reprex.md"}
```

Anyone else can copy, paste, and run this immediately.
  
Instead of reading from the clipboard, you can:
  
- `reprex(mean(rnorm(10)))` to get code from expression. 

- `reprex(input = "mean(rnorm(10))\n")` gets code from character vector (detected via length or terminating newline). Leading prompts are stripped from input source: `reprex(input = "> median(1:3)\n")` produces same output as `reprex(input = "median(1:3)\n")`

- `reprex(input = "my_reprex.R")` gets code from file

- Use one of the RStudio add-ins to use the selected text or current file.

But wait, there's more!

* Set the target venue to Stack Overflow with `reprex(..., venue = "so")`.

* Get a runnable R script, augmented with commented output, with `reprex(..., venue = "R")`. This is useful for Slack, email, etc.

* By default, figures are uploaded to [imgur.com](http://imgur.com) and resulting URL is dropped into an inline image tag.

* Use the `outfile` argument to control where results are left behind. Use `outfile = NA` to work in current working directory.

* Get clean, runnable code from wild-caught reprexes with
    - `reprex_invert()` = the opposite of `reprex()`
    - `reprex_clean()`, e.g. when you copy/paste from GitHub or Stack Overflow
    - `reprex_rescue()`, when you're dealing with copy/paste from R Console

```{r include = FALSE}
options(oo)
leftovers <- list.files(pattern = "README-tmp", ignore.case = TRUE)
unlink(leftovers)
```
